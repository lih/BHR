Revision history for curly
===============

### release-curly-0.59.5 / package-curly-0.59.5

  - Integrate the 'curly-gui' and 'definitive-graphics' packages from old projects
  - Update the repository URLs in the Curly documentation; update the install script to allow installing Bash completions in a standard location
  - Start defining two new builtins, 'showExpr' and 'showSyntax', to help when debugging the behaviour of macros

### release-curly-0.59.4.5 / package-curly-0.59.4.5

  - Change the default Curly locations to follow the XDG specification when possible
  - Correct a small parser bug that caused some interactive commands to need two newlines instead of one
  - Integrate the 'bashcomps.shl' library into the Curly package, so that unprivileged users can still benefit from great completions

  - Change the default Curly locations to follow the XDG specification when possible

So you haven't run away from the front page, and what's more, you even
want to help make things better ? Thank you ! 

That being said, I haven't the slightest idea what sorts of rules
would be good to have, or not have, for my hypothetical future
contributors to feel more welcome.

Hence, until I'm overwhelmed with contributions, there'll only be one
rule : have fun with it. Write the ugliest code you can, or the most
elegant, but write something that makes you smile. This project was
started for fun, and I intend to keep it that way for as long as I
can.

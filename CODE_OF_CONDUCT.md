There is only one rule here : be excellent to each other, and party
on.

Until it proves too much of an burden, I, the original contributor,
will take care of strictly enforcing that rule. I will try my best to
be fair, but if you still find me lacking in that respect, you are
welcome to open a "General Issue" about your disagreement (at [this
address](https://github.com/lih/BHR/issues/new/choose)).
